### Notes and takeaways from the Omaha Workshop on Community Health and Sustainability

The workshop explored issues related to the health and sustainability of open communities (e.g. Open Source, Citizen Science, and Wikimedia). A diverse collection of researchers and practitioners assembled in Omaha to discuss the differences and similarities of their communities and to advance open community health initiatives.

### Going Forward Plans as They Stand

Work Items we're advancing related to open community health and sustainability. 
* White Paper Workshop Summary - UNO Digital Commons - We're writing this up here but will shared with everyone prior to putting it into the digital commons. We're planning on listing everyone at the workshop as an author. This is also where we will capture the start of the discussion on taxonomy. 
* Ford/Sloan Grant - Digital Infrastructure Research - Right now Matt, Sean, Carsten, and Greg have expressed interest. If you would like to join this effort, you're most welcome. 
* ACM-related Workshop Submission (Group, CSCW) - Sean suggested that he would lead this charge. Again, if you would like to join this effort, you're most welcome. 
* Citizen Science Conference Session Submission - Right now Andrea and Greg have expressed interest. Same holds true here, if you would like to join this effort, you're most welcome. 
If you have other things that you think can fit, that's great. We're happy to help in these efforts.
